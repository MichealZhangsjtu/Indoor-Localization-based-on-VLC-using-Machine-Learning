# Indoor-Localization-based-on-VLC-using-Machine-Learning
The Project describes the visible light communication used for localization using machine learning approach, different methods can be apply in order to get the location information i.e. trilateration, fingerprint etc. So each methods has some advantages and disadvantages. The results obtained from each method are also good,  but in trilateration FOV of the receiver is play an important role and results are affected if receiver escalates its FOV, wherein fingerprint, if the length of the database is large then the time taken to predict the location is also increase. Machine learning approach can be apply in order to overcome the aforesaid issues.
